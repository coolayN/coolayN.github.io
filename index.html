            <h1 id="h1-cent">Interests</h1>
            <p>
                I like to spend my free time actively, I enjoy snowboarding, cycling. In the warm season I often go out with my family and friends outside the city.
            </p>
            But sometimes I get great pleasure from the time spent lying on the bed with the TV show.
